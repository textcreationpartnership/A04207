            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:18432:34"/>which afterward followed and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed every where.

               <p>This, I ſay, is ſufficient for our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent purpoſe at this time and in this place. Which alſo being well conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, can not but cauſe every honeſt man to mourne and ſigh before the Lord, beholding this foundation of pietie and godly life to be ſo deſpiſed, yea ſo maligned, and reſiſted, as by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it is now amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g our ſelves, where the Goſpell is, and hath ben enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned (thankes be to God) theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares.

               <p>Only this moreovet for a Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion I deſire may be hoere noted, the ground whereof I take out of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries.

               <p>THE force and evidence of this truth, (viz. touching the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples right for their free conſent in Church governement) is ſuch, that alſo our very Adverſaries ſometimes in plaine termes, ſometimes to the ſame full effect do acknowledge it.

And the like was the power of the Apoſtles al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo towards the Congregations. It was ſuch (I ſay) and none other. Indeed in their Doctrine and teaching they by them ſelves alone inſtructed them, &amp; ſometime commaunded them in the name of Chriſt: but in outward go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement they did not any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, or Lordly, that is, without the Congregations free conſent.

They have po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of Ordination and iuriſdiction, but yet evermore with the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations preſence and free conſent, as their inſtruments doing their actes in the Churches name, and by their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie;

Whence it is that Doct. <hi>Downame</hi> heere ſaith truly, <hi>the ſucceſsion of their owne Clergie fayling, and the helpe of others wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the right is devolved to the whole body of the Church.</hi> If the Doctor will reply &amp; ſay, that this power and right is not eſſentially in the whole Congregation alwayes nor at all times, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times only, that is, in the caſe of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie aforeſaid.

               <p>But let it be remembred, that heere I ſpeake preciſely of <hi>proper Dioceſan Churches,</hi> and larger. There is therefore neceſſarily a diſtinction to be made of Dioceſan Churches. There are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Dioceſan Churches, and larger; &amp; there are improper. The proper Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan Church, and larger, is where the people have no power freely to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the affaires of their ordinarie Church governement. The impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Dioceſan Church, and larger, is where although there be a kinde of Dioceſan, or larger Conſociation of many ordinarie Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregations in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall governement vnder one gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Preſidencie or Superioritie, yet the ordinarie Congregations have their free conſent, at leaſt they have nothing by their Spirituall Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors impoſed on them, againſt their

Such the forraigne reformed Churches at this day do enioy. The other kinde is, where many ordinary Congregations ſo conſociating togeather, have one perſon (a conſtant Preſident during life) over them, whom men after the Apoſtles called a Dioceſan Biſhop (&amp; ſome a Metropolitan) and ſuch like o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther names. Albeit of theſe there were (without queſtion) divers kindes and ſortes, ſome exerciſing greater power and authoritie, ſome leſſe: that is, the ancienter had leſſe, the later for the moſt part alwayes had their power greater and greater.<note place="margin">Ad <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The reaſon is, becauſe truly theſe Churches are not each of them one proper and intire Dioceſan Body, as a proper dioceſan Church is; but hath ſo many diſtinct Bodies and independent, as there are Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie Congregations in each of them inioying their free conſent in their ſeverall governements.

               <p>Againe,<note place="margin">Pag. 88. 89.</note> both the kinds of theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper Dioceſan Churches above ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified (that is, the Synodall &amp; Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall) do guide and rule much alike.

Which immunitie and free power they may
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:18432:49"/>lawfully take to them ſelves, &amp; vſe whenſoever they ſee neceſſary cauſe for it, as even our adverſaries "ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge.<note place="margin">D.

Howbeit yet we affirme that of theſe two the conſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation by Synodes or Presbyteries is moſt convenient, moſt profitable, and moſt ſafe for vs; at leaſt wiſe now, that is, in reſpect of theſe times in which we live, and of the circumſtances in them.

               <p>But what is this to approve the governement of a proper Dioceſan Church, or larger (of which all our queſtion is) where the peoples free conſent is wholy and altogeather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed them: ſuch as I know not cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly either at this day to be, or to have ben any where, but vnder the Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and now in England.

For he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in hand to proove our Dioceſan, or rather Provinciall Churches in England, and our Biſhops (who do all things in Eccleſiaſticall governement without any free conſent of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Congregations) to be for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of their calling and condition Apoſtolicall, hee pleadeth only in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall for Dioceſan Churches, or lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: and for Biſhops in generall. His proofes (ſuch as they be) are only for the improper Dioceſan Churches, and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:18432:50"/>larger, and for their Biſhops. As if ſimply we did deny them. Or, as if our Dioceſan Churches and Biſhops in England were ſuch. What intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable doubling and deceaving of Gods people is this? What altering the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion? What Equivocating, as bad as Ieſuiticall? This is all that he doth in his ſecond booke of the ſaid Defence, where the proper place is for this point, and where is the very founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all his writing beſide.

               <p>But hitherto I have digreſſed ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the divers kindes of Dioceſan Churches and Biſhops, and of their originall: likewiſe of the deceit of the Defenders of our Church ſtate in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland by Equivocating ſo palpably &amp; by changing the queſtion. The maine point heere in this place is: Seeing the Church governement vnder the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel ought to be alwaies with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples free conſent (which before wee have ſufficiently ſhewed) therefore e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very true Church vnder the Goſpell is only one ordinarie Congregation. And conſequently, no proper Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan Church or larger, is lawfull.</p>
               <p>A ſecond Conſequent alſo is heere hence to be conſidered, To wit, This being admitted that the Church go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement ought to be alwayes with the peoples free conſent, it followeth that ſuch Synods or Presbyteries can not be approoved which rule imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly over the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregations, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe on them (whether they will or no) their actes &amp; Canons vnder ſome ſpirituall penaltie, as Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Suſpenſion, Deprivation, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gradation from the Miniſterie. &amp;c.

                  <hi>Angells,</hi> which is <hi>a more honor able title</hi> then Lord. And therefore that Biſhops may bee called Lords.

But the name <hi>Angell</hi> importeth not ſo much, neither is it given to any Creature in ſuch reſpect. Therfore from the name of <hi>Angell</hi> the title of Lorde followeth not. Indeed the name of <hi>Angell</hi> is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Biſhops becauſe they are Gods meſſengers to ſhew vs his will: not in reſpect of their governement at all, though the Doct. preſumeth ſo to ſay without<note n="“" place="margin">An Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie is no proofe.</note> proofe.

And though hee<note n="“" place="margin">Def. 1.34.46.</note> alleage that the Angel of the church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> in <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.1. be <hi>one,</hi> and <hi>but one,</hi> before many Miniſters, yet neither doth this importe any Lordſhip in him either in name or practiſe, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is this precedence or praeemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence ſignifyed by the word <hi>Angel:</hi> but it is gathered by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paring this word with the knowen circumſtances of thoſe times.

                  <hi>Princes are called Paſtors, and for the ſame cauſe are Lords.</hi> Wherein there is no truth, nor indeed any good ſenſe. The like is that where hee addeth, <hi>the title

All this in holdinge our opinion (I ſay) wre are ſure of.

Therefore this our opinion it ſelf is right godly &amp; pious, and proceeding from God. Contrarie-wiſe, That opinion which neceſſarily forceth men to ſuch impietie and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Conſequentes as<note n="“" place="margin">Pag. 133. 134.</note> before I noted, eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the overthrow of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of faith, the ſame it ſelfe is not of God neither ſtandeth with truth.

It forceth men of neceſſitie to thoſe impious &amp; vnchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Conſequents, as I ſhewed. They can not poſſibly avoyd them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the opinion of our adverſaries, <hi>viz.</hi> who deny the Chriſtian peoples conſent in Church governement to be an Apoſtolike Ordinance and an
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:18432:70"/>immutable co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of Chriſt: and ſo do hold the forme of a proper Dioceſan Church and governement to be lawfull and good; their opinion (I ſay) is not of God, neither ſtandeth with truth.</p>
               <p>Now the caſe ſtanding thus (as moſt cleerly it doth) no man can deny but that in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of theſe certain co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The one ordinary and beſt (as they ſay) the other extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie and only in caſe of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as before hath ben ſhewed.

Seeing God hath made them theirs. Further, the Apoſtle requireth the chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> people to <hi>try the Spirits</hi> of their Teachers <hi>whether they be of God or no.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 4.1.</note> And Chriſt ſaith, <hi>His ſheepe heare his voice: a ſtrangers voice they will flee from.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 10.27.3</note> But they can not thus diſcerne and try, vnles they may reiect their Teachers being falſe and erroneous. And if they may reiect, they may choſe. Yet alwayes (as I ſaid) in the beſt maner they can. Some heere obiect and ſay, The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in deed have power and right, but they have not meanes thus to do, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they want Miniſters. I anſwer, if they have power, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whom have they it? It wilbe ſaid, from God. If the people have power from God, then they have meanes alſo. Otherwiſe God giveth power in vaine. But that is abſurd &amp;c falſe; that God giveth any power in
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:18432:85"/>vaine, or ſuch as can not be acted. If God intend an end (as he doth) in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all power, then ſure hee inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth Meanes alſo to effect the ſaid end. And ſo a Church wanting Miniſters, but having power from GOD, hath Meanes alſo to make Miniſters, and ſo likewiſe to do everie other Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall action. They are not vtterly &amp; altogeather deſtitute of iuſt and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full meanes to performe any ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for their owne vſe in the feare of God: That is, the beſt meanes they have is ſufficient, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they have not ſuch as they would and ſhould have otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>So then, this was the anſwer which the ſaid <hi>Tilenus</hi> gave to that <hi>Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch</hi> Lord. But in deed this is not only <hi>Tilenus</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in this matter: for it hath ben the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon defence of all ſound Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtantes alwayes when they be oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, touching their Miniſterie. Which the common conſent of all our <hi>Atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtators</hi> before cited,<note place="margin">See our very Adverſaries beeren A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove pa. 73. 74. &amp;c.</note> and many other, maketh manifeſt. If any have given other anſweres, yet only this hath ben the firme &amp; ſure anchre to truſt to. Other anſweres are all to weake &amp; vncertain: this only is cleere and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant. Though<note n="“" place="margin">Perpe. gov. Pag. 335.</note> D. <hi>Bilſon</hi> do vniuſtly deny it. A moſt certain deduction of this power and right of the people,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:18432:85"/>from Chriſtes ordinance in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, I have plainly ſhewed before in the ſixt Chapter. Alſo the benefit and fruit of this defence we ſee in all Churches abroad; namely it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in thoſe of <hi>France.</hi> Againſt which the learnedſt of the Papiſtes have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſoundly to reply. So that the Churches there flouriſh and increaſe mightily, bleſſed bee God. Who, but for this anſwer, would certainly both then when <hi>Tilenus</hi> ſo did write, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and ſince, have ben much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and ſtaggered, and no leſſe then ſhamed. As many are now with vs in England, who do ſhunne and deſpiſe this anſwer. Whereby I ſee, that to lay againſt the Papiſtes their other er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors (before we have cleered the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes of our Miniſterie) is in deed vnſeaſonable, and little availeable. For if we be ſhamed in the eyes of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding people, or have not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly what to hold, &amp; ſtand to, when we be vrged to make good the Calling and lawfulnes of our Miniſterie, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes will eaſily with diſtinctions and ſubtile anſweres make a faire ſhew in reconciling other matters (betweene vs in controverſie) to Gods worde, though I graunt they be groſſe. When we are ſhamed in ſo maine a point as the Calling of our Miniſters is, in no
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:18432:86"/>other matter afterward we ſhall, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can we have good ſucceſſe.</p>
               <p>But our adverſaries of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantes in <hi>Englande,</hi> what ſay they to this? How defend they the Calling of our Miniſters againſt the Papiſtes? D. <hi>Bilſon</hi> denyeth vehemently that<note n="“" place="margin">Perpet. gov. pag. 335. 368.</note> 
                  <hi>the peoples</hi> conſent <hi>is eſſentiall</hi> in the making of any Miniſters. I deſire him then to tell vs what is eſſentiall in it. There is no queſtion but ſomewhat is.<note place="margin">The very queſtion is, Who have power eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially to make Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</note> Then what is it, which is eſſentiall in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a Miniſter? If the peoples con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent be not, ſurely I know not what els they will aſſigne to be. And yet, as I ſaid, ſomewhat muſt be. Wherefore I conceave the peoples conſent may be ſaid to be eſſentiall by Gods word in the making of a Miniſter vnder the Goſpell, becauſe no other thing els can be aſſigned by Proteſtants as Eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all therein. The common anſwer in a maner of all men is, that in England our Dioceſan and Provincial Biſhops do give our Miniſters their Calling and Office. Heere I demande, is this Eſſentiall in the Calling of our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, or is it not? I thinke few advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly will ſaye, it is Eſſentiall. For whatſoever is Eſſentiall any where, the ſame is eſſentiall every where; as<note n="“" place="margin">Pag. 81.</note> before I have obſerved. And ſo they muſt deny the true Eſſence of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:18432:86"/>in the forraigne reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches where they have no ſuch Biſhops at all, &amp; where at firſt they had no Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter at all. Therefore they will not ſay, I thinke (I know they can not) that the Ordination by Biſhops is Eſſentiall to Chriſtes Miniſterie vnder the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell. Yet againe, if they ſay not ſo, they anſwer the Papiſt nothing: they ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie not the queſtion. So that what they will reſolve on in this point, Surely no man can well tell. Wherefore heere the craftie Prieſtes and Ieſuites among vs will perſwade vehemently their diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, that they have got the victorie. Seeing wee can not affirme whence our Miniſterie is eſſentially derived &amp; gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven vs. In the end I doubt not, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon defence will be this, that our ſaid Biſhops by their ſole authoritie and power do eſſentially give the Calling of all our Miniſterie. And that from Archb. <hi>Cranmer</hi> &amp; <hi>Ridley</hi> (our firſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Biſhops) they have ſtil ſo done. Let what inconvenience ſoever follow thereof. Be it then ſo. Yet even they likewiſe muſt have it given to them. They (<hi>viz.</hi> thoſe our firſt Biſhops) muſt have it derived vnto them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> others. From whom had they their authoritie and power? Briefly it will bee anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, they had it given them from the Biſhop and Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And that
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:18432:87"/>in deed is the truth the Pope is he, who made Archb. <hi>Cranmer</hi> and <hi>Ridley,</hi> &amp;c. ſuch Biſhops. They had no other Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation ſince. And from them all the reſt of our Miniſters have had their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination to this day. And ſo the effect of all is, that our whole Miniſterie in England ſucceſſively and derivatively cometh from the Pope.<note place="margin">

                  </gap>es de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and do triumph in. It is falſe two wayes. Firſt, whatſoever the Church of Rome did give to Archbi. <hi>Cranmer,</hi> &amp;c. that wholy they tooke away a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, namely when he fel from them. For then they both depoſed him, and excommunicated him. So that they left him no whit of that power &amp; fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction (ſo much as lay in them) which they had given him. But queſtionles if they could give it, they could take it away. Wherefore (ſo ſoone as hee was ours) being thus cut off and excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate from the Church of Rome, hee could not after that have any power (as derived from them) to make Miniſters, nor to do any other Biſhoplie act. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, wee all knowe the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the very Antichriſt, chieflie
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:18432:87"/>in reſpect of their Clergie and Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all governement, and moſt chieflie of all in reſpect of the Pope, from whom all the reſt (as from the Head) doe take their power and authoritie. Now ſhall we ſay that very Antichriſt can have power from Chriſt to make Miniſters? Or that we can have a lawfull Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie derived from thoſe who had their power only from him? It can not bee.<note n="“" place="margin">2. Cor. 6.14, 15.</note> 
                  <hi>What communion hath light with darknes? What concord hath Christ with Belial?</hi> And ſo, what hath Chriſt to do with Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt? Nothing at all. Thus then our conſciences can have no aſſurance, wee can not have confidence in ſuch eſtate of the Miniſterie. But certainly Chriſts true Miniſters among vs in Englande, have a better Original the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this anſwere of our State Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants muſt needes be falſe. Yet in this anſwer who ſeeth not how the Papiſtes do reioyce, triumph, and inſult? Who ſeeth not, how by this they are incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, ſtrengthened, and multiplyed among vs exceedingly? Truly it would pity a mans heart to beholde how this one point putteth life into thouſandes to ſtande vp againſt Chriſtes Goſpell, &amp; the libertie of their Country alſo. For when they heare our ſelves openly to aſcribe to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and to their meanes ſuch a gift of grace, even
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:18432:88"/>that which is our glory, even the holy inſtrument of our faith to ſalvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (for ſo is our Miniſterie) they will ſay, if the branch be holy, the root is more; if the rivers be ſweet, the head-ſpring is delicious. And ſo how can it bee cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, but the Papiſtes thus will bee gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and get great adva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage among vs? Many heere have another refuge, but that alſo helpeth nothing. Say they, as Popiſh Baptiſme is ſo far acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by vs,<note place="margin">The laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge of our Adverſaries taken away.</note> as that with it only wee are held to bee ſufficiently Baptiſed &amp; not to need Baptizing againe when we com from them to the Church of England: So likewiſe wee may acknowledge the Popiſh Ordination to the Miniſterie thus far, and yet nevertheles co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne their Church and ſeparate from them. I anſwere, the caſe is nothing like be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Baptiſme the ſigne of our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation in Chriſt, and the Calling to the Miniſterie. In the word there is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe warrant for not repeating the ſigne of our initiation in Chriſt (which of old was <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> and Baptiſme now is the ſame) though miniſtred by a falſe Miniſterie and Church. As wee may ſee in the<note n="“" place="margin">2. Chron. 30.11.18. &amp; 35.17.18: Ez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:18432:88"/>retaine the outward Calling to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie, or to ſtand in that power and authoritie which is derived from ſuch a Church. There is no ſuch thing can be ſhewed in all Gods booke. Therefore we may not conclude the like in this matter of Ordination to the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, which may bee done for not repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Baptiſme. For by Gods worde Ordination may be repeated, yea cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, after a Miniſterie receaved in Chriſtes true Church: much more after it hath ben receaved in a falſe Church. So that theſe two ordinances of Chriſt are nothing like in this point. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore out of queſtion, Ordination to the Miniſterie as it is derived from Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, muſt be wholy reuounced of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very faithfull man: and may bee (as is ſaid) renewed and repeated in Chriſtes true Church, as occaſion ſerveth. At <hi>Rome,</hi> there is in it both an impiety, and a nullitie. In their adminiſtring of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme there is not a nullitie altogea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; as in that correſpondent example of <hi>Iſraell</hi> in Apoſtaſie before alleadged, it well appeareth. And this is ſufficient for this; though other anſweres may be given alſo. Wherefore this remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, that when wee grant the deſcent of our Miniſterie in Englande to come lineally from the Church and Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> (which we muſt grant, will wee
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:18432:89"/>nill we, if wedeny it to ariſe eſſential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the Chriſtian peoples conſent in each Congregation, all the world ſeeth that we give the <hi>Pope</hi> a maine ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage againſt vs, and we put into his hande a ſtrong engine to draw vs back againe vnto him.

               <p>Beſide this, there is another point of the Churches governement,<note place="margin">The cauſing of Vnitie.</note> namely their Iuriſdiction in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pounding Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, in making peace and vnitie and conſent among Chriſtian people, which beeing aſcribed as proper to Dioceſan and Provinciall Biſhops (as they in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland do ſay it is, and as<note n="“" place="margin">Def. 3.36. &amp;c.</note> D. <hi>Downame</hi> with great vehemencie defendeth) cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly true reaſon will cary it further, it can not poſſibly ſtay there.

Whence it is, that where the Church is Dioceſan or Provinciall (as it is now in England) there is an eaſie paſſage to the Vniverſall: and ſooner they may be combined into one, then where the Churches are limited each to one ordinarie Congregation, the people inioying their free conſent in Church-governement.

Thus the <hi>Catholikes</hi> will have ſtrong advantage ſtill vpon the Provincials. And they will preſſe, that we ought rather to imbrace the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall Church then any Dioceſan or Provinciall independent, as ours in <hi>England</hi> is. Nay, they will ſhewe that (if we will be ſaved) ſimply we muſt be profeſſed members of Chriſtes V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal Church Viſible, ſeeing Chirſt hath ordayned it. And this abſolutly can not be mo then only one in the world. And in this caſe we muſt ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect our opinions in religion which differ from the doctrine of Chriſtes only true Church: we muſt thinke it at leaſt probable, that the doctrine of the ſaid Church is the very minde of Chriſt, though otherwiſe wee might

So that firſt we muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide that our ſelves be in the commu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nion of the ſaid Church. And this, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the former reckoning will proove (as I have ſhewed) to bee the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. And ſo Doctor <hi>Downame,</hi> and the reſt, have ſpun a faire threed. Which fearfull inconvenience and miſchiefe followeth by denying this true Chriſtian Aſſertion, <hi>viz.</hi> that Chriſtes true Viſible Church vnder the Goſpel is only one Ordinary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation: as alſo this, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples free conſent in the Church go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement ought to bee alwayes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>

No more could <hi>Iames</hi> be both appropriated to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and not appropriated at one time. Neither could the proper Biſhops Office bee conioyned with an Apoſtleſhip. For it were in vaine. Seeing the Apoſtleſhip contayneth the whole Biſhoply Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and more too. But the Apoſtles in the Churches adminiſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did no thing in vaine, &amp; idly. Again, though the Apoſtleſhip contained in it the whol office of a proper Biſhop, yet this was<note n="“" place="margin">Declarat. pag. 30.</note> Materially, not Formally.

                     <item>1. That <hi>power to ordaine ſit Miniſters, to convent &amp; diſcharge vnſit (preſcribed to Titus &amp; Timothie) was no power proper to Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts.</hi> Wee grant this wholy, even the Concluſion.

                     <item>The Concluſion of his 2. argument is like to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: therefore we grant it alſo. For this proveth not that <hi>Timothie</hi> or <hi>Titus</hi> were proper Biſhops, which is the queſtion. Yet in the <hi>Minor</hi> where hee ſaith, that <hi>Preſbyteries claime this power comitted to Timothie &amp; Tite, even to ordain, examine, cenſure, &amp; deprive Paſtors.</hi> I deny this to bee true: Preſbyteries claime not <hi>this power.</hi> Neither have they it properly &amp; originally, as <hi>Bucer</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note n="“" place="margin">Pag 33.</note> before.

                     <item>His 3. argument is concluded in no forme. But where he<note n="“" place="margin">Perp. gov. Pag. 391.</note> ſaith, <hi>The precepts of Ordayning, and Cenſuring, are delivered to Timothie and Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, and to thoſe that ſhould ſucceed them vnto the end of the world. Ergo Timothies power &amp; function in this behalfe must bee perpetuall.</hi> This is true likewiſe Materially: but not Formally. Their Succeſſors are to execute the ſame in deed alwayes as touching the material actions. Thoſe things muſt be done: but vnder di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers formes of Miniſteries, or maners of adminiſtration. Heere <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> being properly Evangeliſtes did theſe actions vnder the forme of an Evangeliſticall Miniſterie. Sometime Apoſtles did the ſame actions, but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the forme of an Apoſtolicall Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie. After them, Biſhops did the ſame actions alſo: but vnder the forme of a proper Biſhops office. &amp;c. Wherefore the perpetuitie of theſe actions materially which <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> did, proveth not the Office and Miniſterie of <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> formally to bee perpetuall. This
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:18432:124"/>is a very weake concluſion, and very crooked.</item>
                     <item>His 4. argument is, <hi>The whole Church of Christ ſince the Apostles times without exception hath ſo constred the Apostles wordes to Timothie and Titus</hi> tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching their governement.

               <p>Further, touchinge Impoſition of handes the D. ſeemeth heere to eſteeme it as the very <hi>Ordination</hi> it ſelfe, that it <hi>giveth the power to Preach and Baptize, &amp;c.</hi> But it is not ſo. There are two Eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all partes of Calling to the Miniſterie, <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Ordination:</hi> The impoſing of handes is but a Ceremonie of putting the Miniſter (before made) into poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his right, and a commending of him to the bleſſing of God. Though all theſe actions belong to the people ſo, as before I have ſhewed; yet Impoſition of handes (the Ceremonie) may poſſibly be wanting in a true Miniſter, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Ordination may be without it. Yea, true Miniſters have ben without it. Howbeit, I ſuppoſe Chriſts Church offendeth in omitting it: for though it be but a ceremonie, yet it is Apoſtolike. Where alſo that which followeth, in

And, though Impoſition of hands to Ordination may be ſaid to be <hi>a kinde of Sacrament,</hi> yet the people have the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of it, as I have ſhewed. But <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith,<note n="†" place="margin">Inſtitut. 4.3.16.</note> 
                  <hi>Only Paſtors did it.</hi> Be it ſo: and let them only do it ſtil (for they are the fitteſt inſtrumentes for that purpoſe which the Church can aſſigne) <hi>viz.</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are to be had. This the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is nothing materiall.

Alſo, if no Paſtor can bee had, that then ſome other (the fitteſt they have) may act the Churches godly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, for them, in their name, and by their right receaved fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt their Head.

                  <hi>is to give them not only power and leave to preach the word, and diſpenſe the Sacramentes; but alſo

<pb n="302" facs="tcp:18432:153"/>diſpoſers of them vnder Chriſt; Where he addeth, that<note n="“" place="margin">Pag. 111.</note> 
                  <hi>the moderatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Keyes and impoſition of handes were at firſt ſettled in the Apoſtles:</hi> and that this <hi>cannot be doubted.</hi> It is not ſo.

Not depriving the Church of her former power, but ioyning the Apoſtles &amp; their ſucceſſors to her as her Guides. Withall two thinges further are to bee noted. 1.

<pb n="317" facs="tcp:18432:160"/>is to be noted in his <hi>perpetuall governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church.</hi> Surely this one mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, viz. a <hi>Definition</hi> of Chriſtes true Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church vnder the Goſpell, well performed, would have ſaved a great deale of paines and trouble, &amp; would have preve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted much error.

For the avoyding therefore of this imputation, I have in<note n="†" place="margin">The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Chriſts Viſible Church.</note> another Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe defined the ſaid Viſible Church of Chriſt. Which I did, and reſted not on ſome others who have Defined the Church heertofor, becauſe I deſired to diſtinguiſh cleerly betweene the Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Church, and the Chriſtian; which verily differ not in Accidentes alone, but in kinde of governement and in eſſentiall conſtitution.<note place="margin">The Iewiſh &amp; Chriſtian Church go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement differ ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially.</note> Which diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence I know not who hath touched heeretofore, and included in any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition? In ſo much that from hence hath ariſen no ſmall occaſion of grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous errors. Howbeit yet for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe name of <hi>Definition</hi> or <hi>Deſcription,</hi> I ſtrive not: let men call it what they will.

For whoſe ſakes I will heere againe ſet

                        <hi>A Viſible Church of Christ vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpell, is a Spirituall Body politike of no mo ordinarie Congregations then one; the people alſo having power of free co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent in their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ordinarie governement.</hi> This is ſhorter, &amp; yet as full as the other.</item>
